***First Navbar**
This is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a responsive navbar.
The navbar is fixed at the top of the screen and includes a burger menu icon on the left, 
a title in the center, and menu items on the right.

The CSS code includes media queries for adjusting the navbar layout for screens larger than 600px. 
The JavaScript code toggles a class on the body element to open and close the menu when the burger menu icon or the navbar-overlay is clicked.

The HTML code uses Google Fonts for the font family and Material Icons for the burger menu icon. 
It also includes a link to an external CSS file and a script tag for the JavaScript code.
